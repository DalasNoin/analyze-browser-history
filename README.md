Analyze and Plot Chrome History

The browser history is located in
[Windows:] %LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default
[Linux:]~/.config/google-chrome/Default
Chromium:
[Linux:]~/.config/chromium/Default

The hist.txt file contains the browser history in the format date|url. On linux it can be generated by closing chrome and executing:

sqlite3 History "select datetime(last_visit_time/1000000-11644473600,'unixepoch'),url from  urls order by last_visit_time desc" > ~/hist.txt
